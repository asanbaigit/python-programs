"""
 Write a function called closest that takes a list of numbers L and a number n and returns the largest
  element in L that is not larger than n. For instance, if L=[1,6,3,9,11] and n=8, then the function 
  should return 6,because 6 is the closest thing in L to 8 that is not larger than 8. Donâ€™t worry about 
  if all of the things in L are smaller than n."""

    diff =  n - min(L)
    result = min(L)
    for l in L:
        if l < n:
            if n -l < diff :
                diff = n - l
                result = l
    return result
