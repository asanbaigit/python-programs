"""
Write a function called matches that takes two strings as arguments and returns how many matches there 
are between the strings. A match is where the two strings have the same character at the same index. 
For instance, 'python' and 'path' match in the Ô¨Årst, third, and fourth characters, so the function should 
return 3. """
