""" In Section 6.10 we met the substitution cipher. This cipher replaces every letter with a different letter.
 For instance every a might be replaced with an e, every b might be replaced with an a, etc. Write a program that 
 asks the user to enter two strings. Then determine if the second string could be an encoded version of the Ô¨Årst 
 one with a substitution cipher. For instance, CXYZ is not an encoded version of BOOK because O got mapped to 
 two separate letters. Also,CXXK is not an encoded version of BOOK,because K got mapped to itself. On the other 
 hand, CXXZ would be an encoding of BOOK. This problem can be done with or without a dictionary. """
